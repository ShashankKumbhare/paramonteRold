Description: A serial/parallel library of Monte Carlo routines for sampling mathematical objective functions of arbitrary-dimensions, in particular, the posterior distributions of Bayesian models in data science, Machine Learning, and scientific inference, with the design goal of unifying the automation (of Monte Carlo simulations), user-friendliness (of the library), accessibility (from multiple programming environments), high-performance (at runtime), and scalability (across many parallel processors).
